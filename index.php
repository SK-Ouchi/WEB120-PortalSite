  <h3> Yo! Hey! Hello! My name is Satoru Ouchi. I am an aspiring front-end web developer.</h3>

  <!-- Divider to separate the greeting and the bio/intro. -->
  <hr class="simple-divide">

  <p>Building websites has become a newfound passion. Don't know how it happened but, there is something about it that clicks with me.
     Maybe it is designing  it. I find choosing the right combination of colors or fonts gratifying; it's like giving a website its
     own personality. Could be the coding aspects of it. I enjoy piecing together blocks of code to build the user interface. Dealing 
     with business logic is also a joy. It does have its downsides. You are both the perpetrator and the victim when you assume the
     role of a software developer. I've had lots of coffee fuel code fixing binges.
  </p>

  <p>Outside of web development, I am nerd. Plain and simple. I play videogames and read. I do enjoy physical activites, like 
    weight-lifting and hiking. Cooking and making cocktails are also some side hobbies.
